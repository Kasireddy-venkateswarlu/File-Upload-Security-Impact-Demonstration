When the file.bat is run, it executes few system commands on the user's system and sends command output information to attacker controlled python server. This shows what can happen if a user downloads and runs a malicious file uploaded through a file upload vulnerability. To demonstrate this, the pentester needs to run the listener.bat file, which will capture the data being sent to the attacker's server.
