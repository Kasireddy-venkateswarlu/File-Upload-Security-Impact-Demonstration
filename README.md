When the file.bat is run, it executes some system commands on the user's computer and sends important system information to a server controlled by an attacker. This shows what can happen if a user downloads and runs a harmful file uploaded through a file upload vulnerability. To demonstrate this, the pentester needs to run the listener.bat file, which will capture the data being sent to the attacker's server.
